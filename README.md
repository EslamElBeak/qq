# Quiz-app

Our quiz app has a total of two screens, which are the question display screen and the result screen. 
Each question contains 4 options. Once the user clicks on the option, he moves to the other screen, 
in the final result screen where you can check your score, and you can go back to a test again.
There is also a special Light Mode
